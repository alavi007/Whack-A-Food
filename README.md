# Whack A Food (Unity 3D)

## Description

Test your reflexes in which objects spawn in a 4x4 grid box randomly, and you must click on them to destroy them before the timer runs out. 

## Brief Summary

- It features multiple difficulty levels based on the number of objects that are spawned.
- Lives remain unchanged when the player fails to click the skull game object, while the score decreases when the player destroys it.
- Don't miss any objects (except "the skull") or the game is over.
- When the screen-size is changed to full, you can see the 60-second timer.
